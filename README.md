# 365 Days of ML Challenge - Learning Journey Repository 🚀

Welcome to the 365 Days of ML Challenge Learning Journey repository! ✨

## Overview 📚

In this repository, you will find my learning journey as I embark on a year-long challenge to enhance my machine learning skills and knowledge. The purpose of this challenge is to engage in daily learning and practical application, pushing myself to explore various concepts, algorithms, and techniques in the field of machine learning.🎯

## learning roadmap  🗺️
To guide my learning journey throughout the 365 days, I have outlined a comprehensive learning roadmap. This roadmap encompasses key topics and milestones that I aim to cover during the challenge. It includes:

-**TensorFlow and Keras:** Progressing from basic to advanced concepts of TensorFlow and Keras, including building neural networks, implementing deep learning algorithms, and optimizing models for better performance.

-**Deep Learning Architecture Implementation from Scratch:🧠** Understanding the inner workings of deep learning algorithms and implementing them from scratch using Python and keras/Tensorflow to gain a deeper understanding of their mechanics.

-**Research Paper Summarization and Implementation:** Exploring cutting-edge research papers in the field of machine learning and summarizing their key findings. Implementing the proposed methods and comparing them against existing techniques.

-**MLOps (Machine Learning Operations): ⚙️** Exploring the deployment and management of machine learning models in real-world scenarios. Learning about continuous integration, continuous deployment, and monitoring techniques to build scalable and reliable ML systems.

-**Building Production-Level Projects:🏭** Working on projects that simulate real-world scenarios, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance optimization. Emphasizing best practices for building production-level ML projects.

-**Reinforcement Learning: 🤖** Delving into reinforcement learning algorithms, exploring topics such as Markov decision processes, Q-learning, policy gradients, and deep reinforcement learning, with applications in robotics, game playing, and more.

-**Explainable AI:🕵️‍♂️** Understanding techniques and methods for interpretability and explainability in machine learning models. Exploring model-agnostic and model-specific interpretability techniques to ensure transparency and accountability in AI systems.
